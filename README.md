[IFOA DSWP eXplainable AI](https://ifoadatascienceresearch.github.io/explainable-ai/)

### Intro

This repository is a supplement to the __[All Clear](https://www.theactuary.com/issues/2022/03/march-2022)__ article in The Actuary Magazine. The main aim is to show an application of SHAP (SHAP_markdown.pdf) but I uploaded all supplementary materials for those interested (scripts folder).

### Aims

Demonstrate concepts behind XAI with a view to myth busting the notion that “Machine learning models are black boxes”
Provide guidance notes around embedding XAI practices in any future actuarial work relying on AI. (Note that there is potential crossover here into Ethical AI and attitudes to AI in general).
